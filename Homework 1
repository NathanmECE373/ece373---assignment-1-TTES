1) A. BUGS
	Currently,  it is not possible to enable signal-driven I/O by specifying O_ASYNC when 	calling open(); use fcntl(2) to enable this flag.

	One must check for two different error codes, EISDIR and ENOENT, when trying  to  		determine  whether  the kernel supports O_TMPFILE functionality.

	When  both O_CREAT and O_DIRECTORY are specified in flags and the file specified by 	pathname does not ex‚Äêist, open() will create a regular file (i.e., O_DIRECTORY is 		ignored).

   B.  The files "sys/types.h", "sys/stats.h", and "fcntl.h" must be included to use the open() 		function

   C.  The functions chmod(), chown() and close() are the first three listed system calls 		relating to open()
   
   D.  The system call "close()" does not appear to have any bugs listed in the man pages.  The 		only file that must be included to use this function is "unistd.h".
   
   
2) A.	The struct "usb_device" is defined in the file "usb.h".
	The first five members of the struct are listed below:
		struct usb_device {
			int		devnum;
			char		devpath[16];
			u32		route;
			enum usb_device_state	state;
			enum usb_device_speed	speed;
			
   B.	The type for the fifth member of the struct is declared in the header file "ch9.h"
   
   C.  The enumeration declaration for enum usb_device_speed is copied below:	
   	enum usb_device_speed {
		USB_SPEED_UNKNOWN = 0,			/* enumerating */
		USB_SPEED_LOW, USB_SPEED_FULL,	/* usb 1.1 */
		USB_SPEED_HIGH,			/* usb 2.0 */
		USB_SPEED_WIRELESS,			/* wireless (usb 2.5) */
		USB_SPEED_SUPER,			/* usb 3.0 */
		USB_SPEED_SUPER_PLUS,			/* usb 3.1 */
	};
